# dvswitch_instance
This is a simple script that will allow you to generate multiple instance of dvswitch.

It currently supports 2 thru 5 for instance number.

If your wanting a second instance simply

```
sudo ./dvswitch_instance.sh 2
```
You can do this all the way up to 5, script is geared toward DMR but can be modified for 
all bridges.
